# English-to-French-Translation
I have also made some This project is about to Translate the text from English to french and vice versa using different architectures of Neural Network. There are a lot of files in this repository so it might get a little bit confusing in the beginning but believe me, It would be great fun. Let's get our hands dirty with the code.

small_vocab_fr.txt: is the dataset file that contains 137861 sentences in french which works as our French dataset.
small_vocab_en.txt: is the dataset file that contains 137861 sentences in English which works as our English dataset.

For each line in one dataset file(en/fr), we are having each line of English sentence in en dataset corresponding to the same sentence in the French dataset. This is how for all 137861 sentences in English, we are having the same number of sentences in French and now all we need to do is map these inputs and outputs with a black box function which is Neutral Network in our case. We can use English sentences as input and French sentences as output, As well as French sentences as input and English sentences as output. It all depends on our requirements for projects on text preprocessing.
